# תַּכְלֵס

Note: It's a bit difficult to translate *tachles* in a way that fully
grasps the concept, but when applied to conversation *straight talk*
or *hard talk* is probably a good-enough approximation. Let me put it
this way: in this country, it's considered rude to beat around the
bush. So please take this as an invitation to speak your mind freely,
it will be much appreciated.
So with this we go to our first question:



Is there, or has there ever been, a policy in effect at your company
to
# discourage collaboration
between your own OpenStack engineers and those of any other company?


In the OpenStack space, where is real
# innovation
happening?


How does
# marketing mind share
compare with
# user base market share?


Should Ubuntu have gone
# all cloud
instead of
# cloud and mobile?


Is it a
# missed opportunity
for the Foundation to not act as an independent
# certification body
for OpenStack knowledge?


What is the
# greatest benefit
that
# distro vendors
add to the OpenStack community?


What is the
# greatest benefit
that
# public cloud providers
add to the OpenStack community?


Where is the greatest potential for
# disruptive business
built on OpenStack?
