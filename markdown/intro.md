### OpenStack Israel June 2014
# Closing Panel

Note: In this closing panel of today's OpenStack Israel conference, we
would like to explore a defining feature of the OpenStack community,
namely the coexistence of...


## Collaborative development
### &
## Competitive business

Note: And now that OpenStack is going into its 5th year and the
business community around it is maturing, and with it the associated
competition, maybe it's time to ask:


# Have the gloves
# come off?

Note: Is this the end of the honeymoon? Are the forces of competition
taking over? Or is this is a great new opportunity for OpenStack to
maintain its collaborative engineering model while fostering
competitive business?
